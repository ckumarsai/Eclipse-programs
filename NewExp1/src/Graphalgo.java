	 * graph algorithms:
	 * -----------------
	 * algorithm means step by step process to solve the problem.
	 * graph--graph is the pictorial representation of the particular problem.
	 * 
	 * types of algo:
	 * --------------
	 * -breadth first search
	 * -depth first search
	 * -minimal spanning tree
	 * -disjakstra algorithm
	 * 
	 * 
	 * breadth first search:breadth first search start from starting vertex and 
        covering all the  vertex and nodes in the graph.
        
	 * depth first search:  depth first search is also like a breadth first search but 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * time complexity of sorting algorithm:the time complexity of sorting algorithm is the  O(n-1)
